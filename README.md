# knpwrs is Learning C++

I am working through the books [Professional C++, Third Edition] and [Effective
Modern C++]. Beyond what the books cover, I am also going to be using [CLion],
[CMake], [Travis], and [Google Test] along my educational journey.

## Background

C++ was actually the first "real" language I learned back in High School. I
never got into the really advanced topics, however, and I started using Java as
my primary language in college before moving on to Scala and then JavaScript.
One of my friends has been raving about how awesome C++14 is so I decided to
give it a go.

## License

Most of the code will be out of the books with possibly a few modifications here
and there. See the book licenses for license information regarding the code in
this repository.
